# Nterrupt - Screen Time Break Manager

**Nterrupt** is a personal-use Android app to help manage your screen time.  
It monitors selected apps and forces you to take a **10-minute break** after using them for a set duration.

## ‚ú® Features

- Requests all necessary permissions upon first launch:
  - `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS`
  - `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`
  - `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`
- Re-checks permissions each time the app is opened, and requests again if missing.
- Lists all installed apps on the device.
- Allows selecting/deselecting apps to interrupt.
- Per-app time limits: **5, 10, or 15 minutes** of usage.
- Locks selected apps when the time limit is reached.
- Shows a countdown screen during the 10-minute enforced break.
- After the break, the app can be used again.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. Open Nterrupt and grant the required permissions.  
2. Select which apps you want to monitor.  
3. Set a maximum usage duration for each app.  
4. Once you reach the limit, the app is locked.  
5. A **10-minute countdown screen** is shown.  
6. After the break, access to the app is restored.
